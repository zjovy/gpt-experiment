# Experimenting with GPT 3.5

## Briefly describe what the code is supposed to do. ##
The code is supposed to set up a tool for software development teams to start swarms and notify
their teammates. A team member can easily fill out information for a swarm, including start time, end time,
description, and link. Then other team members will be notified and indicate whether they will join
the swarm or not.

## Does the code work? If not, what's broken. ##
The front-end of the code works perfectly, but the back-end side integrating with database and Discord
could not be finished in time. It is a lot more complex and requires more conversations with GPT.

## How is the code better than what the team currently has? ##
The code is better in that it has a header and a footer component.

## How is the code worse? ##
The code is worse in that it only has the front-end working and not connected to any database.

## How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles? ##
It took a 1-2 tries to get good front-end code, but it is very difficult to get the codebase
working after spliting the code into a client side and a server side. ChatGPT 3.5 can't seem to find
the error.

## Overall impression of the experience ##
Overall, ChatGPT is great for setting up a project and help you get started, but you need to understand
the code it is writting so you can debug it and tweak it to fit with your expectations. It generates
front-end code and CSS very fast and relatively well.
