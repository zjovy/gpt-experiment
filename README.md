# Experimenting with GPT 3.5

## Does the code work? If not, what's broken. ##
The code worked after trying to split it into a client side and a server side.
Update: GPT 4 helped fix this bug, but GPT 3.5 misdirected me.

## How is the code better than what the team currently has? ##
The code is better in that it has a header and a footer components.

## How is the code worse? ##
The code is worse in that it only has the front-end working and not connected to any database.

## How many tries did it take to get the code? Main struggles? ##
It took a 1-2 tries to get good front-end code, but it is very difficult to get the codebase
working after spliting the code into a client side and a server side. ChatGPT 3.5 can't seem to find
the error.

## Overall impression of the experience ##
Overall, ChatGPT is great for setting up a project and help you get started, but you need to understand
the code it is writting so you can debug it and tweak it to fit with your expectations. It generates
front-end code and CSS very fast and relatively well.
